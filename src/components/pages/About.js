            I am a full stack web developer, continually learning and building
            my skills on both the front-end and back-end. I also
            have a background in product line management, customer service,
            leadership, visual merchandising, and sales. My educational
            background consists of a Certificate in full stack web development
            from UNC Charlotte and a Bachelorâ€™s of Science degree in Exercise
            Science. I am an effective communicator with exceptional capability
            in attention to detail and passionate about engaging my audience by
            creating a positive user experience that is impactful and user
            friendly.

            My goal as a web developer is to build new apps, improve current
            apps, and continually learn and implement new skills to become more
            well-rounded as a developer. I am excited to leverage my skills in
            both web development and customer service, in order to cultivate
            quality web applications.
